1. Anatomy of HTML Element:
    - Element - tells the browser what kind of content each part of an HTML document represents
    - Element name = Tag name
    - Element attributes - always defined as part of the start tag and have a NAME and VALUE
        - not all attributes require a value
    - Element content - tree structures
        - Void element (self-closing element) - does not contain any content
            - Example: <input .... />

2. Bootstrap:
    - Applying classes - use class attribute, used to associate related elements
    - Basic Bootstrap classes:

        - btn - creates button
        - well - groups elements with an inset effect

        - Example: class="btn btn-primary"
    - Modifying size:
        - class name with -lg or -sg

    - (for buttons) Button block: btn-block
    - Tables:
