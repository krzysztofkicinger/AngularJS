How to modify static HTML page to use AngularJS?
1. Add script element that points angular.js
2. Create an angular module.
3. Add ng-app to html or body HTML tag

Create an angular module - use angular.module(...) method:
angular.module([ModuleName], [ArrayOfDependentModules])

Example:
var todoApp = angular.module("todoApp", []);

ng-app attribute:
Specifies that the element contains a module that should be compiled nad processed by
AngularJS

AngularJS supports MVC - requires to break the application into three distinct areas
    - data of app (model)
    - logic that operates on data (controller)
    - logic that displays data (view)

Tasks:
1. Separate the data from HTML elements -> CREATE MODEL -> JSON Notation
2. Create Controllers:
    - use angularModule.controller(...) method
    - Convention: <name>Ctrl / <name>Controller

    - Controller tasks:
        - provide the data views require - you don't always want views to have access
          to the complete model, so you use the controller to explicitly select those
          portions of data that are going to be available - SCOPE ($scope)
    - $scope (argument):
        - $ refers to build-in service, which is SELF-CONTAINED component that
          provides features to multiple controllers
        - @scope is special and is used to expose data and functionality to views
    - You need to specify the region in HTML that controller is responsible for
        - HTML Attribute - ng-controller="<nameController>"
        - Example: ng-controller="todoCtrl"
3. Views:
    - DATA BINDING - {{<modelElement>}}
    - Example: {{todo.user}}
    - Context of data binding is evaluated as JS expression
    - You can access elements that are assigned to $scope.<objectName>

    - ng-repeat - generate the for-each loop for each object in the collection
    - Format: <name> in <collection/array>

4. Two-Way Model Binding:
    - Two-way binding - where model is used to generate elements and changes in the element cause
      corresponding changes in the model
    - ng-model ATTRIBUTE - creates two way biding between the value of HTML element and model value
        - Counterpart of JSF value attribute
    - Two-Way binding can be applied to elements that takes user output (elements associated with HTML form elements)

5. Controller behaviors:
    - Controllers define behaviors on the scope (functions that operates on the data in the model)
    - Behaviors are defined by adding functions to the $scope
    - Useful with directives: ng-hide - hides the element (+ subelements) if the expression that is assigned as the
      attribute value evaluates to true (manipulates DOM automatically based on the AngularJS model)
